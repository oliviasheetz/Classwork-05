		<figcaption>I <b>LOVE</b> traveling around the world. When I am older, I hope to go on many trips around the globe to see and experience new and exciting things. My favorite way to travel is by airplane because of all the amazing views, especially over water!</figcaption>

		<figcaption>My favorite way to start my day is by watching the sunrise. Almost every morning in the summer I watch the sunrise over the ocean. It is a <b>GREAT</b> way to relax and have your day off to a great start.</figcaption>
